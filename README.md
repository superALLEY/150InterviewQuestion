 # 150 Interview Questions - LeetCode & More

Welcome to the 150 Interview Questions repository! This collection is designed to help you prepare for technical interviews by solving a curated list of problems from LeetCode and other popular coding platforms. Each problem is carefully selected to cover key topics and patterns that are frequently asked in coding interviews.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into different categories based on the type of problems:
 
- Array
- String
- Linked List
- Tree
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting and Searching
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Math
- Greedy
- Graph
- Others

Each problem folder contains:

- Problem Description: A detailed explanation of the problem statement, including input and output formats, and examples.
- Solution: The implemented solution in Python (or any other language).
- Explanation: A step-by-step explanation of the approach and logic used to solve the problem.

## Problem Example

### Remove Element

Problem Description:  
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in-place and return the new length of the array.

Example:
Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3  
Output: 2, nums = [2, 2, _, _]  

Solution:  
The function iterates over the array, shifting elements that are not equal to `val` to the front. The resulting array contains all elements except `val`, and the function returns the new length.
